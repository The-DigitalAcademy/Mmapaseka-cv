             I have a lot of experience with HTML, along with CSS and JavaScript. I find these languages complement each other and help me keep the main newsfeed looking fresh and sharp. I also take professional development courses regularly, 
             and I'm a consistent contributor to online code repositories.‚Äù</p>
